# React Chat Example

An example repository demonstrating how to build a chat application with React and Node.js. See the full tutorial [on my blog](https://www.sohamkamani.com/reactjs/chat-application/)

## Running the application

First, install all the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

You can start the server by running:

```
node server/index.js
```

The react application can be started in development mode by running:

```
npm start
```

And visiting [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To run a production build, run the command:

```
npm run build
```

And visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (once the server is running).
